### Introduction
---

This project simulates the creation of a dataset based on music sessions in a pub over the period of a month. I've drawn on my own experinece in the subject matter and come up with a series of variables, and then tried to simulate their qualities to create a dataset.

### Contents of repositry
---
This repositry contains:
- **the_session.ipynb** - jupyter notebook with the main project
- **README.md** - this file
- **requirements.txt** - text file listing all of the required python packages
- **.gitignore** - file containing filenames/packages for `git` to ignore
- **data** - folder containing csv files outputted from the notebook
- **images** - images used in the notebook

<br>

---
### Installation
---
The jupyter notebook requires a python environment with all of the listed packages in the requirements.txt file installed. The easiest way to do this is with Anaconda which is available from here - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.

<br>

---
### Run
---
Once installed, or the appropriate python environment set up, you can run the jupyter notebooks directly from `Terminal` (or whatever command line interface you are using). First you need to download the notebook locally, navigate to that location on Terminal, and then open the jupyter app by typing jupyter lab. The app will open in a browser window but runs on your local machine. To start you should click on the `kernal` menu and select `Restart Kernal and Run All`.

### The notebook
---
The notebook is fairly self explanatory. It begins with an introduction to the project and a report on the research carried out. It then charts my journey in trying to simulate the data in code. The notebook outputs various csv files to the data folder.

---
### Credits
---
A list of references can be found at the end of the notebook with further references credited throughout the notebook.
