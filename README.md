# The Session

## Programming for Data Analysis Project
## GMIT Autumn/Winter 2021

---
### Introduction

This project simulates the creation of a dataset based on music sessions in a pub over the period of a month. I've drawn on my own experinece in the subject matter and come up with a series of variables, and then tried to simulate their qualities to create a dataset.

### Contents of repositry
This repositry contains a 2 jupyter notebook entitled `the_session.ipynb`, this README.md, a requirements.txt file listing all of the required python packages, and a .gitignore file.

### Installation
The jupyter notebook requires a python environment with all of the listed packages in the requirements.txt file installed. The easiest way to do this is with Anaconda which is available from here - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.

### Run
Once installed, or the appropriate python environment set up, you can run the jupyter notebooks directly from `Terminal` (or whatever command line interface you are using). First you need to download the notebook locally, navigate to that location on Terminal, and then open the jupyter app by typing jupyter lab. The app will open in a browser window but runs on your local machine. To start you should click on the `kernal` menu and select `Restart Kernal and Run All`.
