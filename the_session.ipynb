    "The project brief stipulated that we *\"create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon\"*. It was further suggested we pick something that is of interest to us in our personal or professional life. I've decided to do something on music sessions and try to simulate a dataset based on the attendees at sessions in a given month in a particular pub in Cork city!\n",
    "I'll try to work out all of the variables, examine their properties, potential data types, and how they relate to each other. I'll then try and work out code to simulate a random dataset based on that information."
